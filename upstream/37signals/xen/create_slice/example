Copy the stock image to a new volume on a dom0.
Mount the new volume, and drop in working /etc/network/interfaces, /etc/hostname, and /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.
Generate a Xen config file in /etc/xen/auto.
xm create ...
cool. the copy process is a dd?
Actually, restore.
might as well get a recipe going for it
So, it's really:
/usr/sbin/lvcreate -L 16G -n slice_root VolGroupXen
/usr/sbin/lvcreate -L 2G -n slice_swap
^ VolGroupXen
where can i try this?
Any of the xens.
We need to copy the stock image around, it's currently in my NFS homedir.
/sbin/mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/VolGroupXen-slice_root
/sbin/mkswap /dev/mapper/VolGroupXen-slice_swap
mkdir /tmp/mnt.slice_root
mount -t ext3 /dev/mapper/VolGroupXen-slice_root /tmp/mnt.slice_root
cd /tmp/mnt.slice_root
restore -rf /home/mark/intrepid.dump
cd /
umount /tmp/mnt.slice_root
cool
"slice" is replaced with the name of the slice everywhere, obviously.
